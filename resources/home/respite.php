			<h1>Respite Care</h1>
			<p>
				Here at Overleat we understand that not everybody requires long-term, permanent
				care, and that is why we also provide respite care.
			</p>
			<p>
				Respite care, which also encompasses day care and holiday care, is aimed
				predominantly at people who care for a loved one, and who may benefit from a short
				break.
			</p>
			<p>
				With respite care, people can stay with us for just a few hours, a week, a month, or
				perhaps even longer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Whatever length of time people spend with us, they are always treated the same as
				every other resident at Overleat and it is often a good way of allowing yourself and
				your loved one to gauge whether full-time care would be more suitable.
