			<h1>Why choose Overleat?</h1>
			<p>
				We feel Here at Overleat we are really  a cut above the rest and second only to
				being in one's own home. Our Home is a elegant residence with first-rate facilities
				and equipment throughout. Our staff members, of whom we are enormously proud, are
				top quality too. Warm and friendly, they work as a team to ensure residents' needs
				are met around the clock. Care needs are regularly reviewed with the resident and
				his or her family, if appropriate. Friends and family are welcome to visit at any
				time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our Home has a Social Events Co-ordinator to organise outings and activities and
				befriend residents whose relatives, for instance, live overseas and are not able to
				visit as often as they may wish. We take great care too to ensure that residents
				have plenty in common, so that dining and socialising is a pleasure.
			</p>

			<p>As one relative puts it:</p>

			<blockquote>
				"Our mother came to your Home after she had been attacked by arthritis and was
				unable to do ordinary household tasks such as shopping or cooking. At that time she
				was a shadow of her former self. A few days later I visited her and the
				transformation was miraculous - she is self-assured and happy with restored energy.
				The care, surroundings and happy atmosphere have, we believe, transformed her life."
			</blockquote>

			<h2>Philosophy of Care</h2>
			<p>
				Overleat seeks to provide the highest standards of care to our residents. By using a holistic and
				therapeutic approach, we involve both residents and their families in the planning and delivery of care.
			</p>
			<p>
				An individual care plan is agreed with a named district nurse or key carer and regularly reviewed with the
				resident and their family, if appropriate.
			</p>
			<p>
				Residents are actively encouraged to exercise choice and to enjoy life to their full potential: physically,
				emotionally and spiritually. Stimulating group and one to one activities are encouraged according to
				individual needs, abilities and aspirations. Resident centred care is at the heart of our philosophy.
